## Hallucination 

## Hallucination detection 


## Hallucination detection / Hallucination metric 

1. The hallucination score is either 0 or 1. 0 = no hallucinations
1. Opik uses an LLM as a Judge to detect hallucinations, 
1. we have a prompt template that is used to generate the prompt for the LLM. 
1. By default, the gpt-4o model is used to detect hallucinations (configurable). 
1. You can learn more about customizing models in the Customize models for LLM as a Judge metrics section.
