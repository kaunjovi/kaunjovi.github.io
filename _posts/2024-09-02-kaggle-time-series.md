1. Forecasting is perhaps the most common application of machine learning in the real world. 
    1. Businesses forecast product demand, 
    1. governments forecast economic and population growth, 
    1. meteorologists forecast the weather. 
    1. Data Ingestion Platform forecast time of data feedds. 

1. After finishing this course, you'll know how to:
    1. engineer features to model the major time series components (trends, seasons, and cycles),
    1. visualize time series with many kinds of time series plots,
    1. create forecasting hybrids that combine the strengths of complementary models, and
    1. adapt machine learning methods to a variety of forecasting tasks.

## What is a Time Series

1. The basic object of forecasting is the time series, 
1. which is a set of observations recorded over time. 
1. the observations are typically recorded with a regular frequency, like daily or monthly.

## Linear Regression with Time Series

1. Also called **ordinary least squares** since 
1. it chooses values that minimize the squared error between the target and the predictions

```
target = weight_1 * feature_1 + weight_2 * feature_2 + bias
```
