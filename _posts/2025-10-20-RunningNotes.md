1. **Qubits** : quantum computing posits a quantum bit (or qubit for short) as the centerpiece and most basic computation unit. Qubits are conceptually very similar to the bits. But unlike bits that can exist in a state of either 0 or 1 at any given time, a qubit has a larger state space. This essentially means that a qubit has more possible states to choose from beyond 0 and 1, and can therefore encode a lot more information compared to a classical bit.
1. quantum computers can use the quantum mechanical properties of **superposition** and **entanglement** of the qubits 

1. Powered by multiple qubits that have superposition and entanglement up their sleeve, 
1. quantum computers represent a new model of computation. 
1. Researchers have used quantum computers to solve and propose solutions to NP-hard problems 
1. (e.g. Protein Folding and the Traveling Salesman Problem) and produced 
1. quantum analogs of classical algorithms. 
1. In most cases, quantum computers and algorithms exhibit polynomial and sometimes exponential time speedup over their classical counterparts.

1. Big tech companies are adopting and investing heavily in quantum computing. 
1. Most quantum computers today are ensconced in expensive refrigerated laboratories, 
1. but these companies have connected their quantum computers to the cloud. 
1. These computers are now free for anyone to access and use. 
1. In the last few years, there has also been an active shift to recognize the power of quantum computers in industrial and commercial use cases. 
1. In short, 2021 is a fun time to be learning quantum computing.
1. Let us first turn our attention back to qubits and how they revolutionize the world of computation.

## The classical bit

1. The bit is the most basic unit of information. 
1. It either represents a 1 or a 0. 
1. It as analogous to a switch being on or off. 
1. A bit’s current status, either 1 or 0, is known as its state.

1. The transistor
1. The value of the bit being 1 or 0 are just abstractions. 
1. it is just a transistor, the building block of all modern computers. 
1. When the transistor allows the passage of current through it we consider this event to represent the 1 and 
1. when the transistor blocks the passage of current we consider this event to represent the 0.

## The quantum bit

1. The quantum bit can represent 0, 1, or both simultaneously. Kaise ??? 
1. This phenomenon is called superposition. 
1. For now, we just need to accept that it’s possible to be 0 and 1 at once.

1. A qubit can be built using any two-level quantum system. An example could be a phosphorus atom within a silicon superconductor.
1. Tangle Lake, Intel's 49-qubit chip.
1. The first takeaway here is that the superposition of 0 and 1 is not some third possible state of a bit. It is a special state that we cannot describe by using a classical bit.
1. 


Think of a slider moving between the values from 0 to 1. 
A superposition of 0 and 1 means our current state is somewhere on the slider, 
it could be a little more towards the 0 side, or it could be a little more towards the 1 side. 
We see from this slider analogy that there are infinitely many possible states 
that we can call “being both 0 and 1 at the same time”.

An equal superposition state would mean 50% of the qubit is a 0 and the other 50% of it is a 1. 

An equal superposition state would mean 50% of the qubit is a 0 and the other 50% of it is a 1. Using this way, we can think of the 
|0> state to be 100% 0 and 0% 1. 
Similarly, we can say the 
|1> state is 0% 0 and 100% 1.


One of the key differences is that all these operations have to be reversible.

Willow quantum chip
first-ever algorithm
quantum computer can successfully run a verifiable algorithm on hardware, surpassing even the fastest classical supercomputers (13,000x faster)
2019 - Back in 2019, we demonstrated that a quantum computer could solve a problem that would take the fastest classical supercomputer thousands of years.
2024 - Late last year (2024), our new Willow quantum chip showed how to dramatically suppress errors, solving a major issue that challenged scientists for nearly 30 years

Human limits are features 
Our forgetfulness helps us see patterns and stay creative. AI remembers everything — and often gets trapped in repetition instead of abstraction.
