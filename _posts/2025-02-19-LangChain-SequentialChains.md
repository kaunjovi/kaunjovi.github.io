1. **What is a Sequential Problem?**
1. Create itinerary 
    1. human : going x. what to do. 
    1. ai : here is a list 
    1. human : only for the days 1 and 2 
    1. ai : oh then you can do only a, b 
    1. human : create itinerary for day 1 and 2, with a , b 
    1. ai : here you go, o free thinker. 
1. IMHO, this is a **conversational problem**.
