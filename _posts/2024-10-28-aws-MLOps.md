## SageMaker / Deployment Safguards 

1. Rolling out a new model? These safeguards will help you avoid job loss. 
1. Deployment Guardrails 
1. Control the shifting of traffic to the new model. 

## Deployment Safguards / Blue Green deployment 

1. Blue is previous - Green is new. 
1. All at once - Move all at once. Keep monitoring the green for sometime. All well? Kill the blue. 
1. Canary mode - move a small traffic (canary) to green. All well? Move all and kill blue. 
1. Linear mode - move traffic in lineraly spaced steps. You were not sure if the new build will survive the load. So take it up linearly. 
1. Anything went wrong in the deployment ? Auto rollback baby. :) 

## Deployment Safguards / Shadow Tests 

1. Shadow release. Give it a %age of the production traffic.  
1. Compare performance of Shadown to Production. Check in SageMaker Console. 
1. Do you like the looks of it? Promote. If not, demote. 

## SageMaker / interaction with Docker.

## Find-appropriate-page / Horovod 

1. Horovod was originally developed by Uber (ooh)
1. to make distributed deep learning fast and easy to use, 
1. bringing model training time down from days and weeks to hours and minutes (ooh again, and I thought they were just cab guys)
1. With Horovod, an existing training script can be scaled up to run on hundreds of GPUs in just a few lines of Python code (what are they running)

## Find-appropriate-page / Ludwig 

1. Uber has done this entire abstraction over Tensorflow and opensourced it to "Democratize Deep Learning" in 2019.
