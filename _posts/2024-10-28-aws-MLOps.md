## SageMaker / Deployment Safguards 

1. Rolling out a new model? These safeguards will help you avoid job loss. 
1. Deployment Guardrails 
1. Control the shifting of traffic to the new model. 

## Deployment Safguards / Blue Green deployment 

1. Blue is previous - Green is new. 
1. All at once - Move all at once. Keep monitoring the green for sometime. All well? Kill the blue. 
1. Canary mode - move a small traffic (canary) to green. All well? Move all and kill blue. 
1. Linear mode - move traffic in lineraly spaced steps. You were not sure if the new build will survive the load. So take it up linearly. 
1. Anything went wrong in the deployment ? Auto rollback baby. :) 

## Deployment Safguards / Shadow Tests 

1. Shadow release. Give it a %age of the production traffic.  
1. Compare performance of Shadown to Production. Check in SageMaker Console. 
1. Do you like the looks of it? Promote. If not, demote. 

## SageMaker / interaction with Docker.


## Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Serveice)

1. https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356923#overview
1. Launch and manage K8 cluster on AWS 
1. alternative to ECS (???)
1. Two launch nodes 
    1. Want to deploy EC2 instances. Fine. 
    1. Want serverless? Sure. Use **Fargate** 
1. Use case : 
    1. You are already invested into K8. 
    1. Using them on prem or on some other cloud provider - GCP, Azure etc. 
    1. You would like to move to AWS. Welcome by EKS. 

1. Expose the EKS cluster with a private or a public load balancer. 
    1. EKS Private Service LB (ELB). 
    1. EKS Service LB (ELB). 

1. **Different Node types**
1. Do it yourself / Self Managed Nodes 
    1. You create the Nodes. 
    1. You register them with EKS. 
    1. You register them with ASG. 
1. Delegate the job / Managed Node Groups 
    1. It will create and manage Nodes for you. 
    1. These nodes will be part of an ASG group. The ASG group will be managed by EKS. 
    1. On-demand nodes will be increased. Supports Spot instances too. 
1. You have money. Dont want to know about all these details. Use **Fargate** 

1. **Data Volumes** 
1. Come back and try to understand again ?? ?? ??

## VPC ?? 
## AZ ?? 
## Auto Scaling Group (ASG) ?? 
## IAM / Create Role ?? 
## CloudWatch events ?? 
1. Can it work as a trigger when a file arrives. 


## AWS step functions 

1. https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45286959#overview
1. Can it work as a trigger when a file arrives. 
1. Lets you design workflows in the AWS.
1. Lets you wait for something else to happen (outside the function?)
1. Maximum execution time of a state machine is 1 year. 
1. JSON based, Amazon Statels Language (ASL)
1. https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45286975#overview
1. Workflow = **state machine** - this is a machine that is changing states, and might be back and forth. 
1. Every step = **state**
1. Step can be a 
    1. **task** = Lambda, 3rd party API, other AWS services etc. 
    1. 



## AWS Batch 

1. https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/46732159#overview

1. AWS Batch vs. AWS Glue 
1. Glue is focussed on ETL.
    1. Batch is for any computing job as long as there is a Docker impage of the capability.

## Find-appropriate-page / Horovod 

1. Horovod was originally developed by Uber (ooh)
1. to make distributed deep learning fast and easy to use, 
1. bringing model training time down from days and weeks to hours and minutes (ooh again, and I thought they were just cab guys)
1. With Horovod, an existing training script can be scaled up to run on hundreds of GPUs in just a few lines of Python code (what are they running)

## Find-appropriate-page / Ludwig 

1. Uber has done this entire abstraction over Tensorflow and opensourced it to "Democratize Deep Learning" in 2019.
