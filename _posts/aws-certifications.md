1. The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS. 
By using the Framework you will learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable
systems in the cloud.

## Introduction


## [Welcome to the TOGAF® Standard, Version 9.2, a standard of The Open Group](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/)


## [AWS Well-Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?ref=wellarchitected-wp&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc&wa-guidance-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-guidance-whitepapers.sort-order=desc)

## [Operational Excellence Pillar - AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/welcome.html)

1. The focus of this paper is the operational excellence pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. 
It provides guidance to help you apply best practices in the design, delivery, and maintenance of AWS workloads.
The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the benefits and risks of decisions you make while building workloads on AWS.
By using the Framework you will learn operational and architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable workloads in the cloud. 
It provides a way to consistently measure your operations and architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement.
We believe that having Well-Architected workloads that are designed with operations in mind greatly increases the likelihood of business success.

1. The framework is based on six pillars:
    1. Operational Excellence
    1. Security
    1. Reliability
    1. Performance Efficiency
    1. Cost Optimization
    1. Sustainability

This paper focuses on the operational excellence pillar and 
how to apply it as the foundation of your well-architected solutions. 
Operational excellence is challenging to achieve in environments where 
operations is perceived as a function isolated and 
distinct from the lines of business and development teams that it supports. 
By adopting the practices in this paper you can build architectures that provide 
insight to their status, are activated for effective and efficient operation and 
event response, and can continue to improve and support your business goals.

This paper is intended for those in technology roles, such as chief technology officers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations team members. After reading this paper, you will understand AWS best practices and the strategies to use when designing cloud architectures for operational excellence. This paper does not provide implementation details or architectural patterns. However, it does include references to appropriate resources for this information.

## [What Is AWS?](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/1851/play/135839/aws-technical-essentials-part-1;lp=1044)

## Cloud computing deployment models

1. On prem / Cloud / Hybrid 

1. On-premises
1. hosted and maintained hardware such as compute, storage, and networking equipment in their own data centers. 
1. They often allocated entire infrastructure departments to take care of their data centers, 
1. which resulted in costly operations that made some workloads and experimentation impossible. 

Cloud
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with primarily pay-as-you-go pricing. 
With cloud computing, companies do not have to manage and maintain their own hardware and data centers. 
Instead, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) own and maintain data centers and 
provide virtual data center technologies and services to companies and users over the internet.

Hybrid

A third option is a hybrid deployment. This type of deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. The most common method of hybrid deployment between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure connects cloud resources to internal systems to extend and grow an organization's infrastructure into the cloud.



## AWS / Data Centers and Availability zone (AZ)

1. https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/1851/play/135839/aws-technical-essentials-part-1;lp=1044
1. Pictures on my laptop. Can get destroyed. Upload on AWS data center. 
1. Alien comes and destroys the AWS data center. 
1. AWS had thought about this and had backed up the AWS data center with another one 
1. using 
    1. redundant 
    1. high speed and 
    1. low latency connection. 
1. This is known as a AWS availability zone (AZ)
1. AZ has one or more data centers. With redundant power, network and connectivity. 



## AWS / Region 

1. https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/1851/play/135839/aws-technical-essentials-part-1;lp=1044
1. A cluster of AZ using 
    1. redundant 
    1. high speed and 
    1. low latency connection. 
1. Is called a region. 
1. Region are scattered across the world and are named as such e.g. North virginia region 

1. The list of all regions across the world ???

## AWS / How to chose the region to save your information? 

1. Consider the following aspects. 
1. Compliance - are you constrained to keep data within some geography 
    1. Are you required to keep your data within UK? Choose *London region* and stop thinking anymore about it. 
    1. Are you in Canada? Might be pick the *Canada central* region. 
1. Latency - what kind of response times do you need? Is there a benefit of being closer to most of your users? 
    1. If your users are in Oregon, might be put the photos in the *Oregon Region* 
1. Service availability - Not every service is available everywhere. Choose your place. 
1. Pricing - Some region e.g. *Sao Paolo* has higher pricing, due to tax reasons. 


## AWS Global infrastructure
1. Global Edge Network, consists of 
    1. Edge Locations - Amazon CloudFront - 400+ edge locations are available currently. 
    1. Regional Edge Caches 

## Every action that you make in AWS is an API call that is authenticated and authorized.

1. AWS application program interface (API)
    1. AWS Management Console
    1. AWS command line interface (CLI) - can access CLI through AWS CloudShell, using console. 
    1. AWS Software Development Kits (SDK) - Python, Java, NodeJs 

1. AWS Management Console - Just getting started? Stick to this. 

1. Check out this python snippet for interacting with AWS ???

```python
import boto3
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2.describe_instances()
print(response)
```

## Security and compliance are a shared responsibility between AWS and you.

1. https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/1851/play/135839/aws-technical-essentials-part-1;lp=1044
1. Customer is responsible for Security *in the* cloud. 
    1. Customer data. Encrypt. Customer side. Server side. 
    1. OS. Firewall. 
    1. 
1. AWS is responsible for Security *of the* cloud. 
    1. Region. AZ. Compute. Storage. Database. Networking. etc. 
    1. AWS Global Infrastructure that cloud is running on. 
    1. AWS backbone / private fiber cables 
    1. Compute. Storage. Database. Network. 

## [Protecting the AWS Root User](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/1851/play/135839/aws-technical-essentials-part-1;lp=1044)

1. When you first access AWS, you begin with a single sign-in identity known as the root user.
1. Do everything that you can do to protect the root user. Strong password. Multi factor authentication.
