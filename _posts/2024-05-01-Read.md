## Bigeye 

1. Bigeye founders, Kyle Kirwan and Egor Gryaznov, 
1. Egor led Uber’s first SQL bootcamp shortly after being hired, and 
1. Kyle attended it just to make sure this new Egor guy actually knew his stuff. 
1. they worked on the data pipelines for Uber’s in-house A/B testing tool—
1. to report out standardized metrics for the company’s 1000s of experiments—
1. where data quality was becoming a considerable challenge.

With 100s of petabytes and 1000s of weekly data users, 
Uber’s data platform had grown in size and scale—along with the number of people and applications that depended on it. 

Testing is good but doesn’t scale.
Automation is important, but so is maintaining control and understandability.
Analysts and engineers should work with the same tools to avoid blocking each other.

In 2019, Kyle and Egor founded Bigeye—a data observability platform designed for data people, by data people. 
Bigeye’s platform does the work to improve the reliability of every dataset and pipeline.

1. Take Dataform as an example. 
1. You can easily create SQL-based pipelines in GCP 
1. without having to learn a new framework like dbt or faff around with local development. 
1. It’s basically free, and it’s just there in the UI, which is pretty cool.
