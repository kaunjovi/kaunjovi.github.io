## [S3](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356505#notes)

1. Infinitely scalable storage. ??? 
1. Used for backup (Disaster recovery, Archive) and storage 
1. Archival service - S3 Glacier - Nasdaq stores 7 years of data in S3 glacier 
1. Hosting - media and applications (???) - static website 
1. Software delivery 
1. DataLake 
1. Big data analytics 
1. Industry usage : Sysco runs analytics on S3 

## [S3 / Buckets](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356505#notes)

1. Store objects (files, other things ... ) in buckets (directories)
1. Buckets have globally unique names - across all regions all accounts 
1. Buckets are defined at region level 
1. NOT a global service - buckets are created in regions. 
1. Naming convention - no underscore, no uppercase, 3 to 63 chars (why 63???), 
    1. Not an IP 
    1. must start with lowercase or numbers 
    1. Not allowed - prefix xn-- - suffix -s3alias 

## More about regions and zones ???

## [S3 / Objects](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356505#notes)

1. Objects (files) have a key. Key Value pair where value is an Object (???). How will you design a S3 storage???
1. key is the full path. it is prefix + the object name. 
1. Name examples 
    1. s3://my-bucket/ key or the full-path 
    1. s3://my-bucket/ my-file.txt 
    1. s3://my-bucket/ myfolder/my-file.txt 
    1. s3://my-bucket/ myfolder/another-folder/my-file.txt 
1. Object can be anything - file, video, media, application. 
    1. Max object size is 5TB (5000 GB)
    1. Bigger file? multi-part upload 
1. Objects will also have 
    1. Metadata - by the system and by the user. 
    1. Tags - for security and lifecycle 
    1. Version id - if applicable / enabled. 
1. S3 pre-sgined URL and a public URL 

## More about securing Amazon account. MFA ??? 

## [S3 / Security](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356515#notes)

1. User based - IAM policies 
    1. which api is to be allowed. to which specific user from IAM. 
1. Resource based - bucket wide rules - set from s3 console - applies to users from some other account as well. 
    1. this is how you make S3 bucket public. 
    1. Object Access Control List (ACL) - 
    1. Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - 
1. When can an IAM principal access a S3 object if 
    1. IAM permissions allow OR resource policy allow 
    2. AND there is no explicit deny 

## More about IAM, IAM principal

1. User in the www - you dont know. Outside person on the www. 
1. IAM user - user within the account. 
    1. IAM policy can be applied. 

## [S3 / Security / Bucket Policies](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356515#notes)

1. S3 Bucket Policies 
1. Usage 
    1. Grant access to public / another account 
    1. Force objects to be encrypted at upload 
1. JSON based policies 
    1. Resources : Buckets and Objects 
    1. Effect : Allow or Deny (anything else possible? Read / write? )
    1. Actions : API to Allow or Deny (e.g. GetObject )
    1. Principal : that is you, the user 
1. EC2 instances - are not users - hence are not IAM users - create IAM roles instead
    1. EC2 instance role 
    1. Put policies on that. 

1. Bucket policies - when the accessor is not subject to our policies. 
    1. The public user on internet www. 
    1. An IAM user from another AWS account. 

1. Block public access. Default opiton. You will have to undo it to add any other policy. 

## [S3 / versioning](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356523#notes)

1. Versioning has to be enabled at bucket level 
1. Same key object - upload again ? will just add another version 
1. Any key boject - Delet ? Just a "delete" Marker. Easy to restore back to "Delete"d version? Yes. 
    1. Or you could "permanently delete" and then God help you. 
1. Any file before "version" was enabled - has a "null" version 
1. If "versioning" is suspended, the previous versions are still available. 
    1. Can we have "restore" points then by enabling versioning, checking in a restore point, then disabling versioning again? 

## [S3 / Replication](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356533#notes)

1. Cross Region Replication (CRR)
1. Same Region Replication (SRR)
    1. S3 Batch Replication - for existing object and objects that have *failed replication*. 
1. Asynchronous - what does that mean ?? 
1. OOH - and buckets can be in different AWS accounts as well 
1. Proper IAM permissions to "S3 service" so it has the permission to read and write 
1. Usage 
    1. SRR - live replication between production and test accounts. 
    1. CRR - ??? 

1. After you enable replication - only new objects are going to be replicated. Alongwith the versions. 

1. There is no CHAINING of replication 

1. Safety against mailicious delete 
    1. There is no DELETE replication of permanent delete 
    1. For delete marker there is an optional setting to replicate. 

1. UI / Management tab / Replication rules 

## [S3 / Storage Classes](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356545#notes)

1. Durability - 11 9s across multiple AZ 
    1. 10 million objects - in S3 - every 10 thousand years - you might lose one object 
1. Availability - 
    1. S3 standard has 99.99% availability. 53 minutes a year, unavailable. 

## [S3 / Storage Classes]

1. [S3 standard](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356545#notes) 
    1. S3 standard has 99.99% availability. 53 minutes a year, unavailable. 
    1. Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures (???)
    1. Usage 
    1. Big Data Analytics 
    1. Content distribution - hmm - so, static HTML websites? 
1. [S3 Standard-Infequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356545#notes)
    1. Less frequently accessed. But need rapid access when needed. 
    1. 99.9% avialable (??? minutes per year)
    1. Usage : DR, backups. 
1. [S3 One Zone-Infequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356545#notes)
    1. 11 9s Durability in a single AZ. Data lost when AZ is lost. 
    1. 99.5% avialable (??? minutes per year)
    1. Usage : Secondary backup copy of on-premise data. 
        1. Data you can recreate ??? 
        1. Why? This data is virtually impossible to destory. Why then is it suitable for data that can be recreated?
1. [S3 Glacier Storage Class](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356545#notes)
    1. Low cost backup / archiving. You pay for storage and for retrieval. 
1. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
    1. Millisecond retrieval. Data accessed once a quarter. 
    1. What kind of data is that? There are quarterly reports but they are *generated* every quarter. Not accesssed every quarter. 
    1. Minimum storage - 90 days. 
1. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval / formerly Glacier
    1. Experdited - 1 to 5 minutes retrieval
    1. Standard - 3 to 5 hours 
    1. Bulk - 5 to 12 hours (free)
1. Glacier Deep Archive 
    1. Minimum storage - 180 days 
    1. standard - 12 hours, bulk - 48 hours 
1. [S3 Intelligent Tiering](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate-mla-c01/learn/lecture/45356545#notes)
    1. small monthly monitoring and auto-Tiering 
    1. How do you use it. Will move automatically based on the usage pattern.
