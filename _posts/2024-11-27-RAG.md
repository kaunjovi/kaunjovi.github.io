1. LLM without RAG 
1. The knowledge of RAG is constrained 
1. Large Language Model (LLM) on its own has a predefined training dataset that serves as its “internal knowledge.” 
1. You would like to add to its knowledge somehow 
1. Fine Tuning a LLM or a RAG 

1. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
1. RAG is a framework LLM uses to get relevant, up-to-date, and context-specific information 
1. by combining retrieval and generation capabilities.
