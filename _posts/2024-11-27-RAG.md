1. Swarm is an experimental, open-source Python framework from OpenAI

## RAG vs Agentic RAG: A Comprehensive Guide 

1. https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/11/rag-vs-agentic-rag/

1. LLM without RAG 
1. The knowledge of RAG is constrained 
1. Large Language Model (LLM) on its own has a predefined training dataset that serves as its “internal knowledge.” 
1. You would like to add to its knowledge somehow 
1. Fine Tuning a LLM or a RAG 

1. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
1. RAG is a framework LLM uses to get relevant, up-to-date, and context-specific information 
1. by combining retrieval and generation capabilities.



The process flow of an Agentic RAG System for handling user queries. Here’s a breakdown of each component:

## What the f**k is Agentic RAG? 

Agentic RAG refers to a more intelligent and dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation system where 
Agentic: The system works on its own, making decisions and taking actions depending on the situation.

1. an “agent” plays a key role in orchestrating processes. 
1. The agent intelligently determines which resources or databases are most relevant for a user’s query, 
1. making it capable of handling more complex, multi-tasking scenarios. 
It is an evolution from traditional RAG systems, 
offering greater adaptability and decision-making by incorporating additional logic or heuristics into the retrieval and response generation pipeline.
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): It mixes information from a knowledge base with the AI’s ability to create responses.



## What is Agentic Design Patterns?

1. https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/10/agentic-design-patterns/
1. The agentic design pattern is introduced as a solution for making LLMs more autonomous. 
1. Instead of just giving the model one prompt and expecting a final answer (like writing an essay in one go), 
1. an agent-like approach involves prompting the LLM multiple times, step by step. 
1. Each step refines the task, with the model improving its output iteratively.
1. When we prompt an LLM in zero-shot mode, it’s like asking someone to write a story in one go without revising. 
1. LLMs do well at this, but they can do even better. 
1. By using an agent-like workflow, we can prompt the LLM multiple times in steps. 
1. Each step builds on the previous one, refining the response. 
1. Think of it like asking the LLM to go over the essay multiple times, improving it with each pass.


## Example of usage of Agentic Design Pattern 

1. writing a code using Agentic workflow: 
Plan an outline for the code: Break down the task into smaller modules or functions.
Gather information and content: Research libraries, algorithms, or existing solutions. Do web searches or check the documentation if needed.
Write the first draft of the code: Implement the basic functionality, focusing on structure over perfection.
Review the code for inefficiencies or errors: Check for unnecessary code, bugs, or logic flaws.
Revise the code: Refactor, optimise, or add comments for clarity.
Rinse and repeat until the code is efficient and clean.


## What is the criteria for Retrieval ? 

## What is a Vector Database ? Why is it important for Agentic RAG ? 



## How does Agentic RAG system work? How does it handle user queries? 

1. The system receives a user query.
1. Does the query fit the criteria for retrieval (it is part of the vector database).
