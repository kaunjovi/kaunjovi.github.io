1. [What is a Delta table in Databricks?](https://medium.com/event-driven-utopia/what-is-delta-table-in-databricks-b660b80ecc5a)

1. Delta tables are a new type of table in Databricks 
1. They are optimized for fast, read-intensive, large-scale data processing and are 
1. ideal for use cases such as data lakes.
1. A Delta table is essentially a **versioned version** of a data lake table 
1. that is stored as a collection of small data files in a **hierarchical file system**, 
1. Not as a single monolithic file. 
1. This allows for fast, incremental processing and 
1. enables you to keep track of changes to the data over time.
