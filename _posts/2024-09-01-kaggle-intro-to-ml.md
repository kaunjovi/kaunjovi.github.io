1. [How Models Work](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dansbecker/how-models-work)
1. Take some existing data e.g. data about cost of houses sold in an area. 
1. Now, divide the data into buckets based on features that you think is impacting the outcome i.e. sale price. 
1. Simple, naive scenario. The sale price is only depended on whether the house had more than 2 bedrooms or not. 
1. Then predicted prices is the historical average of all sales in that category. 
1. We could use data to find more such patterns. 
1. **fitting** / **training** the model = the process of finding such patterns. 
1. **training data** is the data used to **fit** the model. 
1. This model is then used to **predict** prices for new set of homes.
