## Target Date Fund (TDF)

1. Long term investment with a Target date by which it is expected to end e.g. Retirement 
1. In the early years, investments are made into riskier assets, 
1. where there is a longer time period to recover any short term losses 
1. Nearer to the end, the assets get far more heavily into conservative assets.  
1. It is rebalanced periodically to optimize returns over the long term
1. Example : Vanguard Target Retirement 2070 Fund (VSVNX)
1. Target-date funds are popular with 401(k) plan investors
1. don't have the time or the inclination 
    1. to review their fund's holdings annually and 
    1. revise their investment strategy appropriately
1. In general, a target-date fund may have a higher expense ratio than a standard mutual fund. 
    1. Target-date fund is a fund of funds that invests in other mutual funds, 
    1. adding a double layer of fees paid by the investor.
    1. since the fund rebalances regularly, it is more active than a standard index fund.
1. Most plan providers today offer a target-date fund among their choices for 401(K) and / or Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA)



## **RetirePlus Select** is a kind of Target Date Fund. 

1. Different from a regular Target Date Fund, however, 
1. TIAA Traditional Annuity is included in the RetirePlus Select model 
1. to provide enhanced retirement options and 
1. guaranteed income in retirement through these annuities. 

## **A plan default investment**

1. A plan default investment is for participants who do not select an investment lineup themselves 
1. after they select to invest funds in any TIAA account(s). 
1. For example, if a new employee selects TIAA for their UA Pension Plan contributions, 
1. but does not select their own investment line up with TIAA, 
1. contributions will automatically be routed to RetirePlus Select - the default investment option. 
1. Participants can update their default investments at any time.
