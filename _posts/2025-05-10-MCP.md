## Model Context Protocol (MCP)
1. Released in Nov 2024
1. [Core architecture of MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture)
    1. Hosts are LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections
    1. Clients maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application
    1. Servers provide context, tools, and prompts to clients

```Python
class Session(BaseSession[RequestT, NotificationT, ResultT]):
    async def send_request(
        self,
        request: RequestT,
        result_type: type[Result]
    ) -> Result:
        """Send request and wait for response. Raises McpError if response contains error."""
        # Request handling implementation

    async def send_notification(
        self,
        notification: NotificationT
    ) -> None:
        """Send one-way notification that doesn't expect response."""
        # Notification handling implementation

    async def _received_request(
        self,
        responder: RequestResponder[ReceiveRequestT, ResultT]
    ) -> None:
        """Handle incoming request from other side."""
        # Request handling implementation

    async def _received_notification(
        self,
        notification: ReceiveNotificationT
    ) -> None:
        """Handle incoming notification from other side."""
        # Notification handling implementation
```

1. Request interface 

```python
interface Request {
  method: string;
  params?: { ... };
}
```

1. What is params?: 

1. Results come back from server, if successful 

```python 
interface Result {
  [key: string]: unknown;
}
```

1. What is [key: string]: unknown;

1. Or Errors could come back 

```python
interface Error {
  code: number;
  message: string;
  data?: unknown;
}
```

1. What is data?: 

1. And you could have one way Notifications also. They don't expect a response. 

```python
interface Notification {
  method: string;
  params?: { ... };
}
```

1. Standard Errors. 

```python
enum ErrorCode {
  // Standard JSON-RPC error codes
  ParseError = -32700,
  InvalidRequest = -32600,
  MethodNotFound = -32601,
  InvalidParams = -32602,
  InternalError = -32603
}
```

1. Connection **initialization** sequence between Client and Server 
    1. Client sends initialize request. Gives protocol version and capabilities. what are they?? 
    1. Service sends protocol version and capabilities. what are they ?? 
    1. Client sends notification that all is good. 
    1. Messages back and forth commenses. 
    1. These are either Request-Response or Notifications. 
    1. Close can be either close(), Transport disconnection, or Error condition. 


1. Deploy in Claude desktop. Huh?? 
1. [What is Claude Desktop and How-To Use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkt_g6RV1o0)
1. Free layer uses Haiku. The paid model uses Sonnet??
