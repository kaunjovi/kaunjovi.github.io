## Leadership 

1. **How to Raise Concerns at Work**
1. https://medium.com/code-like-a-girl/how-to-raise-concerns-at-work-81fdae8cc6b3
1. Do your homework. Have data. Know your solution. 
1. But raise risk, say concern, and request for advise. 

## Lakehousing: Removing one of the biggest performance killers in Silver-to-Gold processing
1. https://christianhenrikreich.medium.com/lakehousing-removing-one-of-the-biggest-performance-killers-in-bronze-to-silver-processing-8ed4ce372de6

1. When working with lakehousing, 
1. we’ve learned that data cleaning should happen during the processing phase between Bronze and Silver. 
1. What is Bronze and what is Silver ?? 
1. data cleaning : removing duplicates or replacing missing values.
1. 
1. However, there is an often-overlooked issue that should also be addressed, 
1. one which can significantly increase both cost and processing time if only corrected at the Silver-to-Gold stage. 
1. 
1. The issue arises when we have columns whose values aren’t correctly formatted, and 
1. we end up compensating for it in our predicates during Silver-to-Gold processing.
1. A common example is using non-integer keys such as GUIDs.
1. 
1. Often, we have no guarantee on the case (uppercase or lowercase) of GUID values when ingesting data from other systems. 
1. This could be handled by calling either lower() or upper() in the predicates during Silver-to-Gold processing.
1. 
1. What are predicates ?? 



## non-sargable queries 
1. When we apply functions to columns in our predicates, 
1. we lose the ability to leverage table optimizations and statistics. 
1. In nearly all data systems, it is considered bad practice to call functions on columns in a predicate 
1. because it renders queries non-sargable.
1. Id + 1 becomes a function which do the addition

```sql
# Wrong
SELECT Id, Name FROM persons WHERE Id + 1 = 2
SELECT Id, Name FROM persons WHERE Add(Id, 1) = 2 

# Correct
SELECT Id, Name FROM Persons WHERE Id = 2 - 1
```

1. Establish clear formatting rules for columns on your data platform. 
1. decide whether uppercase is the standard for enums or system labels, 
1. whether lowercase is the standard for GUIDs, and 
1. specify how decimals should be formatted.
1. the ideal practice is to stick with integer keys whenever possible
1. enforce these rules during Bronze-to-Silver processing.


1. What is Microsoft Fabric ??

INNER JOIN 
JOIN and INNER JOIN will return the same result.
INNER is the default join type for JOIN, so when you write JOIN the parser actually writes INNER JOIN.


## Delta and Parquet: Integer, GUID/UUID or SHA256 as ID?

## R&R of AI Engineer ( builds upon software engineering skills )

1. Build applications on top of pre-trained foundation models like GPT-4 or LLaMA
1. Focus on model adaptation through prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and fine-tuning
1. Prioritize scalability, evaluation, inference optimization, and real-world deployment
1. Handle end-to-end systems including security, data handling, and user feedback

1. **What do you need to know**

1. Some math fundamentals — Statistics, probability, and basic linear algebra will help you understand what’s happening under the hood. You don’t need a PhD in mathematics, but you should at least conceptually understand concepts like matrix operations and probability distributions.
1. Python programming — You will need to be able to write production-level code even to deploy your own AI applications. Strong Python skills are pretty much non-negotiable in the field.
1. Basic software development concepts — Version control with Git, command line basics, and understanding how to work with APIs. You’ll need to know how different services communicate and how to manage your code effectively.
1. Fundamental ML concepts — Even if AI Engineers don’t often train models from scratch, understanding the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, basic model evaluation metrics, and concepts like overfitting and underfitting will give you the vocabulary to understand more advanced topics.

1. **Where do you start** 
1. Learn to use AI APIs — Services like OpenAI’s API let you integrate powerful models without needing to build them yourself. This is the fastest way to start building real applications with AI capabilities.
1. Understand prompt engineering — Learning how to effectively communicate with AI models is a crucial skill. Well-crafted prompts can dramatically improve model outputs and are essential for getting consistent results.
1. Build simple RAG applications — This involves connecting AI models to your own data sources using vector databases and embedding techniques, so they can answer your queries more effectively.
1. Experiment with different pre-trained models — Using resources like Hugging Face to access models others have created. This gives you experience with different model architectures without having to train or finetune them yourself.
1. Basic application architecture — You’ll start learning how to structure AI applications with proper input handling, context construction, and output processing.

1. Start with DataCamp 
1. DataCamp offers excellent courses to help build your AI engineering foundation:
1. For developers looking to integrate AI into applications, their Associate AI Engineer for Developers track teaches you how to work with the OpenAI API, Hugging Face, LangChain, and vector databases like Pinecone.
1. For those with a data science background who want to dig more into working with foundation models themselves, the Associate AI Engineer for Data Scientists track helps you transition to AI engineering.
1. And if you’re a complete beginner, the AI Fundamentals track provides a no-code introduction to core AI concepts.
