I am a fan of Cloud services and in particular AWS Cloud. 
I have been working with AWS services since 2018 when 
I realized how powerful the AWS infrastructure is and how convenient its services are for developers, 
compared with equivalent services offered by traditional hosting services in data centers.

Recently I was able to receive 2 AWS certifications, 
Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) and 
Developer Associate (DVA-C02). 
And in this short article I want to share my journey and study plan and resources which helped me prepare for the exams. You can check out my certifications on LinkedIn.

# AWS Exam structure

1. multiple choice and multiple response (??)

1. Choosing the best service for a particular scenario (e.g. KMS vs Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store to store application credentials)
1. Choosing a chain of services to solve a problem (e.g. using an Application Load Balancer with EC2 Auto Scaling vs Lambda functions with API Gateway)
1. Optimizing existing services for a specific use case (e.g. adding RDS read replicas for huge read traffic or converting to Multi-AZ for disaster recovery)
1. Service options (e.g. S3 encryption options: SSE-S3 vs SSE-KMS vs SSE-C)
1. you should also consider the cost factor when selecting an answer. 
1. if a solution suggests using EC2 On-Demand instances and another solution is about using a single Lambda function (or Spot instances), you should probably choose the second answer.
