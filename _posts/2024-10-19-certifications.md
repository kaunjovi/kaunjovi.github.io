## Certifications 

1. Cloud 
    1. AWS 
    1. Google 
1. AI/ML 
    1. edX  


## How much study is requried for AWS certifications ? 

1. typically between 40 to 80 total hours of study is required. 
1. Our AWS Certified Associate Courses are 10 to 20 hours long, and 
1. require about 4 hours of study for every 1 hour of video.

# AWS Exam structure

1. multiple choice and multiple response (??)

1. Choosing the best service for a particular scenario (e.g. KMS vs Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store to store application credentials)
1. Choosing a chain of services to solve a problem (e.g. using an Application Load Balancer with EC2 Auto Scaling vs Lambda functions with API Gateway)
1. Optimizing existing services for a specific use case (e.g. adding RDS read replicas for huge read traffic or converting to Multi-AZ for disaster recovery)
1. Service options (e.g. S3 encryption options: SSE-S3 vs SSE-KMS vs SSE-C)
1. you should also consider the cost factor when selecting an answer. 
1. if a solution suggests using EC2 On-Demand instances and another solution is about using a single Lambda function (or Spot instances), you should probably choose the second answer.


1. once registered - training academy - ??

## [Random Forests @ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dansbecker/random-forests)

1. A deep tree with lots of leaves will overfit 
1. because each prediction is coming from historical data from only the few houses at its leaf. 
1. But a shallow tree with few leaves will perform poorly because it fails to capture as many distinctions in the raw data.
1. Even today's most sophisticated modeling techniques face this tension between underfitting and overfitting. 
1. But, many models have clever ideas that can lead to better performance. 
1. We'll look at the random forest as an example.
1. The random forest uses many trees, and it makes a prediction by averaging the predictions of each component tree. 
1. It generally has much better predictive accuracy 
1. than a single decision tree and it works well with default parameters. 
1. If you keep modeling, you can learn more models with even better performance, but many of those are sensitive to getting the right parameters.

```
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

forest_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=1)
forest_model.fit(train_X, train_y)
melb_preds = forest_model.predict(val_X)
print(mean_absolute_error(val_y, melb_preds))
```

1. Import Random Forest 

```
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
```

1. Instantiate the model and fit 
```
forest_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=1)
forest_model.fit(train_X, train_y)
```

1. Make some predictions 

```
melb_preds = forest_model.predict(val_X)
```

1. Check how much are we off on average 

```
print(mean_absolute_error(val_y, melb_preds))
```
