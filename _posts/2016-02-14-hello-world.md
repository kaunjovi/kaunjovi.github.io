### How to setup git command line to connect with github account? 

```

git config --global user.name "kaunjovi"
git config --global user.email "kaunjovi@gmail.com"

// Where is this git from? 
git remote -v 

// How many files are there to be checked in? 
git status 

// What are the changes
git diff 

// Add the file in  
git add filename
git commit -m "blah"
git push 

```






### A pedantic way to push changes to git. 
```
git add --all && git commit -m "new version" && git push 
```
It is a bit pedestrian but, it is guaranteed not to eat too much system resource. And it will not run without me knowing. 

There was the other one. But, one, I could not get it to work. Second, I could not get it to work. Third, it is a little too clever script for me. I could not make head or tail out of it. Or how is it supposed to work.
