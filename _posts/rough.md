## Business / How does the firm T make money? 

1. [read]()

1. TIAA’s business has two main parts: 
    1. First, it acts as recordkeeper for the retirement plans of institutions like 
        1. Cornell University, 
        1. the University of North Carolina System and 
        1. most of the nation’s 107 historically Black colleges and universities. 
    1. Second, TIAA earns money as an asset manager on 
        1. in-house mutual funds and 
        1. insurance products sold to investors 
        1. both inside and outside those (retirement) plans.        
        1. Annuities are contracts that promise to provide income for holders during their lives.

1. Clients 
    1. While most of TIAA’s clients are current or retired workers at nonprofit organizations, 
    1. TIAA also offers individual retirement accounts to investors online.

1. Most of the institutional accounts handled by TIAA 
1. allow participants to invest both in its own products and 
1. also in funds from outside firms like Vanguard or Fidelity. 

1. selling in-house products generates significantly greater profits to TIAA than sales of external offerings.

1. TIAA Traditional, its popular annuity, the company's engine, does not have an “identifiable ‘expense ratio’ or ‘fee,’” the company says. 
1. Chris Tobe, an expert in pension investments and a former trustee of the $14 billion Kentucky Retirement Systems, 
1. said the industry consensus is TIAA makes around 1.2% on TIAA Traditional, 
1. far more than other types of investments. 
1. Craig Parkin, the firm’s head of retirement advice and consulting, 
1. described TIAA Traditional as the company’s “engine” in the recording of a sales meeting last fall.

1. The problem for clients arises when TIAA products promoted by its sales representatives or its advice tool 
1. cost more than its competitors’ or perform poorly by comparison. 
1. An example is a TIAA real estate product the advice tool funnels clients to — 
1. it has significantly underperformed an index of real estate investment trusts 
1. in six of the past 10 years and is down 4.6% in 2024 while the index is up 4.2%.

When Rajotte made his presentation to TIAA employees, 
he cited Yale University’s retirement plans as an example of how TIAA compensates for its losses elsewhere by selling in-house products. 
At Yale, he said, “we’re more than making up for the loss in recordkeeping revenue by what we’re making in the product side.”

1. At a sales meeting  
1. [Thomas Rajotte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomrajotte/) TIAA's director of finance, told employees in a recorded presentation 
1. that the company could secure its future and offset its losses by selling in-house products to clients. 
1. "If they [clients] have Vanguard, we're not earning any money on the product and we're losing money on the recordkeeping," 
1. he said. "Where we make that up is on the product side."


1. Asked if Yale was concerned about TIAA’s in-house products being pushed on its participants to offset losses, the university said in a statement: 
1. “Neither Yale nor any of its plan fiduciaries has access to TIAA’s internal business discussions, nor is it Yale’s role to monitor TIAA.”
1. overseeing its retirement plans are fiduciaries who 
1. “retain independent investment advisers, 
1. who are also fiduciaries to the plans, 
1. to provide expert assistance in identifying suitable investment funds and monitoring their performance. 
1. The plan fiduciaries periodically evaluate whether the investment fund fees that the plans pay TIAA are reasonable.”

1. If a financial firm advises customers to buy in-house investments that make it more money than other vehicles, 
1. it must disclose that fact. 
1. Ditto if a firm rewards sales representatives with higher compensation for directing clients into certain investments.
1. **is that a legal requirement**

1. In the 2021 SEC case, 
1. some TIAA training materials encouraged the firm’s wealth management advisers to **avoid discussing with clients**
1. the fees and expenses associated with shifting their low-cost employee retirement accounts into higher-cost managed accounts. 
1. TIAA misled clients by characterizing the recommendations to move into managed accounts as objective advice, according to the SEC. 
1. The activities occurred from January 2013 through March 2018; 
1. in accepting the settlement from TIAA, the SEC said it considered remedial actions the company took before and after the investigation, 
1. including changes to its disclosures, training, policies and compensation structure.

1. TIAA also tried to propel clients into making investment choices 
1. that would benefit the firm by citing the possibility that they would not have enough money to retire, the SEC said. 
1. “Making the Client Feel the Pain,” was how TIAA’s scripted sales materials characterized the approach. 
1. TIAA said in 2017 that the language in those materials did not reflect the company’s values.

1. The recent push at TIAA, 
1. according to the whistleblower complaint, 
1. differs from the 2021 case by focusing on **its financial consultants**, 
1. the employees who work directly with institutions like Brown University and Harvard.

1. At a meeting last fall, 
1. TIAA’s Parkin told financial consultants that 655,000 of the firm’s clients were “off track” for retirement.
1. They didn’t own enough in-house TIAA products, according to the complaint and a recording of Parkin’s presentation. 
1. Propelling these folks into TIAA Traditional, the annuity, would get them on track, he said. 
1. Even better, it would generate $10 billion for the firm, Parkin said.

1. Getting clients to use TIAA’s online advice tool was the means to this end, Parkin said on the recording. 
1. He also said TIAA’s CEO, Thasunda Brown Duckett, and others in the executive suite 
1. supported his strategy as a top priority to be pursued immediately. 
1. “Thasunda loves her money,” Parkin said on the recording.

1. Like many online advice mechanisms, 
1. TIAA’s Retirement Advisor Field View Tool recommends clients balance their portfolio among various asset classes — 
1. stocks, bonds, money markets and the like — based on risk tolerance, age, income and other inputs. 
1. The tool divides investors into seven types — very conservative to very aggressive — 
1. then steers them to investment options in each asset class, internal documents show. 
1. Clients using the tool to change their portfolio must accept all its suggestions; 
1. a participant cannot accept one recommendation on stocks and reject another on real estate, for example.

1. Most of the asset classes available for users of the tool include an array of investment options that include 
1. both TIAA products and those offered by competitors. 
1. The company’s spokesman said more than 2,500 non-TIAA funds are available to retirement plan sponsors for selection through its recordkeeping platform.
1. But in two asset classes, 
1. the tool’s recommendations are limited to TIAA products, 
1. One is the annuity that Parkin said generates significant profits to the firm; 
1. the other is the lackluster TIAA real estate product.

1. While previously consultants had been encouraged to discuss the tool’s recommendations with clients, 
1. now the employees are tasked with getting a certain number of clients to implement the tool’s advice. 
1. If a consultant persuades at least 170 customers to make changes using the tool, 
1. he or she earns credits toward bonuses accounting for one-quarter of their compensation.

1. Together, its top five executives received $46.2 million last year,  
1. Duckett, TIAA’s CEO, receiving $18.2 million, 
1. up from $17.5 million the prior year. 
1. Of the 18 companies TIAA considered to be peers for pay purposes last year, Duckett received more than CEOs at 10 of them, 
1. including Bank of New York Mellon, Equitable Holdings and T. Rowe Price.
1. TIAA, which operates without profit, 
1. paid its CEO more than the CEOs at most of the for-profit companies it says are peers.

By using the Framework you will learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable
systems in the cloud.

## Introduction


## [Welcome to the TOGAF® Standard, Version 9.2, a standard of The Open Group](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/)


## [AWS Well-Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?ref=wellarchitected-wp&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc&wa-guidance-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-guidance-whitepapers.sort-order=desc)

## [Operational Excellence Pillar - AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/welcome.html)

1. The focus of this paper is the operational excellence pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. 
It provides guidance to help you apply best practices in the design, delivery, and maintenance of AWS workloads.
The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the benefits and risks of decisions you make while building workloads on AWS.
By using the Framework you will learn operational and architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable workloads in the cloud. 
It provides a way to consistently measure your operations and architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement.
We believe that having Well-Architected workloads that are designed with operations in mind greatly increases the likelihood of business success.

1. The framework is based on six pillars:
    1. Operational Excellence
    1. Security
    1. Reliability
    1. Performance Efficiency
    1. Cost Optimization
    1. Sustainability

This paper focuses on the operational excellence pillar and 
how to apply it as the foundation of your well-architected solutions. 
Operational excellence is challenging to achieve in environments where 
operations is perceived as a function isolated and 
distinct from the lines of business and development teams that it supports. 
By adopting the practices in this paper you can build architectures that provide 
insight to their status, are activated for effective and efficient operation and 
event response, and can continue to improve and support your business goals.

This paper is intended for those in technology roles, such as chief technology officers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations team members. After reading this paper, you will understand AWS best practices and the strategies to use when designing cloud architectures for operational excellence. This paper does not provide implementation details or architectural patterns. However, it does include references to appropriate resources for this information.

## [AWS Technical Essentials Part 1](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/1851/play/135839/aws-technical-essentials-part-1;lp=2198)

## [What Is AWS?](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/1851/play/135839/aws-technical-essentials-part-1;lp=1044)

## Cloud computing deployment models

1. On prem / Cloud / Hybrid 

1. On-premises
1. hosted and maintained hardware such as compute, storage, and networking equipment in their own data centers. 
1. They often allocated entire infrastructure departments to take care of their data centers, 
1. which resulted in costly operations that made some workloads and experimentation impossible. 

Cloud
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with primarily pay-as-you-go pricing. 
With cloud computing, companies do not have to manage and maintain their own hardware and data centers. 
Instead, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) own and maintain data centers and 
provide virtual data center technologies and services to companies and users over the internet.

Hybrid

A third option is a hybrid deployment. This type of deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. The most common method of hybrid deployment between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure connects cloud resources to internal systems to extend and grow an organization's infrastructure into the cloud.



## AWS / Data Centers and Availability zone (AZ)

1. https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/1851/play/135839/aws-technical-essentials-part-1;lp=1044
1. Pictures on my laptop. Can get destroyed. Upload on AWS data center. 
1. Alien comes and destroys the AWS data center. 
1. AWS had thought about this and had backed up the AWS data center with another one 
1. using 
    1. redundant 
    1. high speed and 
    1. low latency connection. 
1. This is known as a AWS availability zone (AZ)
1. AZ has one or more data centers. With redundant power, network and connectivity. 



## AWS / Region 

1. https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/1851/play/135839/aws-technical-essentials-part-1;lp=1044
1. A cluster of AZ using 
    1. redundant 
    1. high speed and 
    1. low latency connection. 
1. Is called a region. 
1. Region are scattered across the world and are named as such e.g. North virginia region 

1. The list of all regions across the world ???

## AWS / How to chose the region to save your information? 

1. Consider the following aspects. 
1. Compliance - are you constrained to keep data within some geography 
    1. Are you required to keep your data within UK? Choose *London region* and stop thinking anymore about it. 
    1. Are you in Canada? Might be pick the *Canada central* region. 
1. Latency - what kind of response times do you need? Is there a benefit of being closer to most of your users? 
    1. If your users are in Oregon, might be put the photos in the *Oregon Region* 
1. Service availability - Not every service is available everywhere. Choose your place. 
1. Pricing - Some region e.g. *Sao Paolo* has higher pricing, due to tax reasons. 


## AWS Global infrastructure
1. Global Edge Network, consists of 
    1. Edge Locations - Amazon CloudFront - 400+ edge locations are available currently. 
    1. Regional Edge Caches 

## Every action that you make in AWS is an API call that is authenticated and authorized.

1. AWS application program interface (API)
    1. AWS Management Console
    1. AWS command line interface (CLI) - can access CLI through AWS CloudShell, using console. 
    1. AWS Software Development Kits (SDK) - Python, Java, NodeJs 

1. AWS Management Console - Just getting started? Stick to this. 

1. Check out this python snippet for interacting with AWS ???

```python
import boto3
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2.describe_instances()
print(response)
```

## Security and compliance are a shared responsibility between AWS and you.

1. https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/1851/play/135839/aws-technical-essentials-part-1;lp=1044
1. Customer is responsible for Security *in the* cloud. 
    1. Customer data. Encrypt. Customer side. Server side. 
    1. OS. Firewall. 
    1. 
1. AWS is responsible for Security *of the* cloud. 
    1. Region. AZ. Compute. Storage. Database. Networking. etc. 
    1. AWS Global Infrastructure that cloud is running on. 
    1. AWS backbone / private fiber cables 
    1. Compute. Storage. Database. Network. 

## [Protecting the AWS Root User](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/1851/play/135839/aws-technical-essentials-part-1;lp=1044)

1. When you first access AWS, you begin with a single sign-in identity known as the root user.
1. Do everything that you can do to protect the root user. Strong password. Multi factor authentication.
