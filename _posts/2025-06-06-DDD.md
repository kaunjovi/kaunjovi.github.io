## DDD (Domain-Driven Design ), a software development approach, a methodology

1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** is a software development approach 
1. that focuses on **modeling complex business domains** in code 
1. by aligning software design with real-world business processes. 
1. create a system that reflects the domain's intricacies, making it more maintainable, scalable, and understandable by both developers and domain experts.
1. create a system that reflects the domain's intricacies, 
1. making understandable by both developers and domain experts
1. When would Domain experts read software? When has that ever happened? 
1. What about Domain Experts be required to be IT literate and use IT tech terminologies more liberally. 
1. What happens when business / domain changes? Will the software have to change as quickly? How does that jive with the concept of flexibility and longivity of the software. 

1. **Core Principles of DDD:**

1. **Focus on the Domain** - The primary emphasis is on understanding and modeling the business domain (e.g., banking, e-commerce, healthcare) rather than just technical implementation. 
1. The IT bigwig finds it easier to influence the IT people than change the business. 

2. **Ubiquitous Language**  
1. Developers and domain experts use a **shared, consistent language** to describe domain concepts, reducing misunderstandings.

3. **Strategic Design (Bounded Contexts, Context Mapping)**  
   1. Breaking down large systems into **Bounded Contexts** (logical boundaries where a model applies).  
   1. Defining how different contexts interact (e.g., via **Anti-Corruption Layers** or **Published Language**)

4. **Tactical Design (Building Blocks)**  
   - Using patterns like **Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Repositories, Domain Events, and Services** to model the domain effectively.

## Eric Evans
1. Eric Evans is the creator of Domain-Driven Design. 
1. He formalized the methodology in his 2003 book: **"Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"**  

1. **Key Contributions by Eric Evans:**  
1. Introduced **DDD as a systematic approach** to managing complex software projects.  
1. Defined **strategic patterns** (Bounded Contexts, Context Mapping) and **tactical patterns** (Aggregates, Repositories).  
1. Emphasized **collaboration between developers and domain experts** to build accurate models.  


### **Relation Between DDD and Eric Evans**  
- **DDD = The Methodology**  
- **Eric Evans = The Founder** who defined and popularized it.  

Many DDD concepts (like **Bounded Contexts**) originated from his book, and his ideas continue to evolve through the DDD community (e.g., **Vaughn Vernonâ€™s writings**, **DDD Europe conferences**).

## Bounded Context is a design pattern associated with DDD (Domain-Driven Design )
1. key strategic - adjectives added to lend an aura 

1. In Domain-Driven Design (DDD) by ??? 
    1. specific domain model (entities, value objects, aggregates, etc.)

1. defines the boundaries within which a particular domain model applies
1. each with its own ubiquitous language, rules, and models.
1. Outside this boundary, the same terms might have different meanings or rules.

1. **For example** 
    1. a "Customer" in a Sales Context might differ from a "Customer" in a Support Context.
    1. In Order Context, a "Product" might be a simple SKU with price. 
    1. In an Inventory Context, a "Product" might include stock levels and warehouse locations.

1. **integration patterns** 
    1. like Shared Kernel, 
    1. Anti-Corruption Layer, 
    1. Customer-Supplier

1. **Why? What are the benefits**
    1. Prevents model pollution (mixing different meanings of the same term).
    1. Enables team autonomy (different teams can work on different contexts).
    1. Reduces complexity by decomposing large domains into manageable parts.
