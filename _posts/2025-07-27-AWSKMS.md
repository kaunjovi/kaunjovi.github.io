## What is AWS KMS (Key Management Service) used for ? 

1. AWS KMS (Key Management Service) is a **managed service** 
1. that makes it easy to create and control the encryption keys 
1. used to protect your data across AWS services and your own applications. 
1. Its core purpose is **secure and centralized cryptographic key management**.
1. Create keys with unique alias / nmae and descriptions. 
1. Disable and Enable keys as and when needed. 
1. Who used the key? When did they use the key? Audit trail in AWS Cloud Trail. 
1. What are the different types of keys 
    1. Customer Master Key (CMK)
        1. Upto 4 Kb only 
        1. Limted to the region that they belong to. Cant be exported to another region.  
    1. Data keys 




## Customer Master Key (CMK)

1. **Customer Master Key (CMK):** The primary resource in KMS. It's a logical representation of your key, containing metadata (ID, ARN, policy, description) and pointers to the actual cryptographic material stored in HSMs. CMKs can be symmetric (AES-256) or asymmetric (RSA, ECC).
1. Contains the key material to encrypt / decrypt data 
1. Created within AWS KMS 
1. Never leave AWS KMS un-encrypted 
    1. Symmetric CMKs
    1. Private keys of assymetric CMKs
1. CMK can encrypt data upto 4KB 
1. Used to Generate, Encrypt and Decrypt **Data Encryption keys**
1. **Data Encryption Key** can be used to encrypt large amounts of data. 


## Envelope Encryption 


## Sequence to encrypt data 
1. Take the message to be encrypted. 
1. Take the **data encryption key** 
1. Use any of the encryption algorithm to encrypt your "text message" - different algorigthms are possible e.g. AES 256 
1. Encrytped message = encrypted plain text + Data Encryption Key = **cipher text** 









Here's a breakdown of its primary uses:

1.  **Encryption/Decryption:**
    *   **Data at Rest:** Encrypt data stored in AWS services like Amazon S3, EBS volumes, RDS databases, DynamoDB, Redshift, Secrets Manager, SSM Parameter Store, etc. KMS provides the keys (Customer Master Keys - CMKs) used for this encryption.
    *   **Data in Transit:** Often used in conjunction with services like AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for SSL/TLS certificates or to generate data keys for encrypting data before sending it over networks.
    *   **Your Own Applications:** Use the KMS API (via SDKs or CLI) to encrypt/decrypt data directly within your applications running on EC2, Lambda, ECS, or on-premises.

2.  **Key Management:**
    *   **Centralized Control:** Create, rotate, disable, enable, audit, and define usage policies for cryptographic keys (CMKs) from a single console/API.
    *   **Secure Storage:** AWS KMS stores and protects your CMKs in **hardware security modules (HSMs)** validated under FIPS 140-2 (Level 2 overall, with Level 3 security in some components). You never directly access the CMK itself.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Supports automatic annual rotation of CMK cryptographic material (the backing key) without requiring changes to your applications or needing to re-encrypt data.
    *   **Access Control:** Define fine-grained permissions using **key policies** (attached directly to the CMK) and IAM policies to control *who* (users, roles, accounts) can use the CMK for which actions (encrypt, decrypt, generate data key, manage, etc.).

3.  **Envelope Encryption:**
    *   This is a fundamental pattern KMS enables efficiently and securely.
    *   Instead of sending large amounts of data directly to KMS for encryption (which has payload size limits), you:
        1.  Call KMS to **generate a unique data key**.
        2.  KMS returns a **plaintext data key** and a **ciphertext (encrypted) version** of that same data key (encrypted under your chosen CMK).
        3.  Use the **plaintext data key** in your application to encrypt your large data locally (using a fast, symmetric algorithm like AES-256).
        4.  Store the **encrypted data key** alongside your encrypted data.
        5.  To decrypt: Send the **encrypted data key** to KMS for decryption (under the CMK) to get back the plaintext data key, then use *that* to decrypt your data locally.
    *   **Benefits:** More efficient (avoids sending large data to KMS), allows encryption/decryption offline after initial key retrieval, keeps the primary CMK highly protected.

4.  **Signing & Verification:**
    *   Use **asymmetric CMKs** (RSA or ECC key pairs) to generate digital signatures for messages or documents using the private key.
    *   Verify the authenticity and integrity of those signatures using the corresponding public key (which KMS can provide).

5.  **Integration with AWS Services:**
    *   KMS is deeply integrated with most AWS services that handle sensitive data. When you enable encryption in a service (e.g., checking "Encrypt" in S3 or EBS), you typically choose a KMS CMK to use.

6.  **Auditing & Compliance:**
    *   All usage of KMS CMKs (API calls) is automatically logged in **AWS CloudTrail**. This provides an audit trail showing who used which key, when, for what operation, and from which resource, crucial for security audits and compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Customer Master Key (CMK):** The primary resource in KMS. It's a logical representation of your key, containing metadata (ID, ARN, policy, description) and pointers to the actual cryptographic material stored in HSMs. CMKs can be symmetric (AES-256) or asymmetric (RSA, ECC).
*   **Symmetric CMK:** The most common type. Uses the same key for encryption and decryption. Required for `GenerateDataKey`, `Encrypt`, `Decrypt` operations.
*   **Asymmetric CMK:** Contains a public/private key pair. Used for signing/verification or encrypt/decrypt scenarios where you distribute the public key. Public keys can be downloaded.
*   **Data Key:** A symmetric key generated by KMS (via `GenerateDataKey`) used for encrypting large data locally (envelope encryption).
*   **Key Policy:** The primary resource-based policy document attached to a CMK defining who has access to the key and what they can do with it. IAM policies can grant permissions to *use* keys, but key policies define the *fundamental* access.

**In Simple Terms:**

Think of AWS KMS as a **highly secure vault in the cloud** where you can:

1.  **Store** your master encryption keys safely.
2.  **Control** exactly who (users, services) can access those keys and what they can do with them (encrypt, decrypt, manage).
3.  **Generate** temporary keys (`Data Keys`) for your applications to use to encrypt large amounts of data efficiently.
4.  **Log** every single time anyone uses any key for auditing.
5.  **Integrate** easily with almost any AWS service or your own code that needs encryption.

It's the foundational service for managing encryption keys securely and meeting compliance requirements within the AWS ecosystem.
